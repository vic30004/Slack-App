# Objective

I wanted to create a chat application using the JAM stack. I decided to use firebase for the database because of it's realtime capabilities. 

# How it works

In order to use this application, simply sign up and start chatting. 

# Technologies

For this application, I used React for my front end and firebase for my back-end. Also, I used semantic ui to help speed up styling the appliction.
